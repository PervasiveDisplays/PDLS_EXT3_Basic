> ### The library **PDLS_EXT3_Basic_Global** turns legacy. 
>
> As a replacement of monochrome screens (film `C`), use the screens with wide temperature and embedded fast update (film `K`). 
>
> As a replacement of colour black-white-red screens (film `J`), use the colour black-white-red-yellow screens (film `Q`).

The **PDLS_EXT3_Basic_Global** supports the screens

* iTC [monochrome](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/products/?_sft_product_colour=black-white) (film `C`);
